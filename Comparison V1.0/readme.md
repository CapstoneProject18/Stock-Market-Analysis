# Comparison Module

## Comparison V1.0

- We created a django project to visualise a dummy data.

## Comparison V1.1

- Still in V1.0 - as we did not changed the base <br/>
- We were successfully able to extract data from the 'quandl' api for stock price data in views.py by allowing users to set the company names to compare with start and end date and were successful in plotting it on the web app using chart.js.<br/>
- Next we will also calculate returns by stock, growth of the stock over time and other such functionalities.
